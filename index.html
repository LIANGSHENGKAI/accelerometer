			<h1>Accelerometer</h1>
			<p>The accelerometer consists of a measuring mass (also known as a sensitive mass), a support, a potentiometer, a spring, a damper, and a housing.The tested quality is constrained by the support to move along only one axis, often called the input axis or the sensitive axis.When the instrument shell accelerates along the sensitive axis along with the carrier, according to Newton's law, the detection mass with a certain inertia tries to keep its original motion state unchanged.There will be relative motion between it and the shell, deforming the spring, so the detected mass will accelerate under the action of the spring force.When the spring force is balanced with the inertial force generated when the detected mass accelerates, there will be no relative motion between the detected mass and the shell, and then the deformation of the spring reflects the measured acceleration.A potentiometer, as a displacement sensing element, converts acceleration signals into electrical signals for output.The accelerometer is essentially a one degree of freedom oscillating system, and the damper must be used to improve the dynamic quality of the system.There are many types of accelerometers in classification and working principle. According to the displacement mode of detecting the mass, there are linear accelerometers (measuring the mass for linear displacement) and pendulum-type accelerometers (measuring the mass rotating around the supporting axis).According to the supporting mode, there are gem supports, flexible supports, air floats, liquid floats, magnetic levitation and electrostatic levitation.According to the composition form of measurement system, there are open loop type and closed loop type.According to the working principle, there are vibrating string type, vibrating beam type and pendulum-type integral gyro accelerometer.According to the number of input axes, there are uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial accelerometers.The sensors are classified into piezoelectric, piezoresistive and potentiometer types.It is common to name an acceleration
